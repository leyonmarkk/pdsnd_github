### Project Title
*Bike Share*

### Description
*In this project, I use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The project imports the data and answers interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. This project also takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.*
